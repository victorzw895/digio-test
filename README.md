# Digio Test

My code solution for a test from Digio

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

### Running Solution

```bash
node index.js
```

### Running Test

```bash
npm test
```

## Improvements

- Would change the functions to return a sorted array of the logs, instead of returning a specific amount.
  This would make it better to integrate with a dashboard or other applications that rely on the logs data.
- Improve tests

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Mocha/Chai
- fs filereader
